# Project Overview

**My album** is an application that allow users to store and manage their albums, photos and videos in an easy and secure way.

## Description

**My album** is a web application designed to offer users a secure and efficient way to store and manage their digital albums, photos, and videos. This system leverages a microservice event-driven architecture, ensuring that all service-to-service communications occur asynchronously via a distributed streaming platform, specifically Apache Kafka. This architectural choice enhances the responsiveness and scalability of the platform, facilitating seamless interactions across various services.

The architecture is composed by three main services: User Management Service, File Manager Service and a Web Application.

## Services

The **User Management Service** is responsible for handling the management and authentication of users within the system. This service uses a MongoDB database to save all required information and communicates with other services in an asynchronous way by using Kafka Topics to send messages.

The **File Manager Service** is responsible for allowing users to manage their files. This service uses a Postgres database to save all required information and uses the Amazon S3 service to store the actual files. It also communicates with other services through Kafka topics.

The **Web app** is the frontend web application that allow users to interact with the system.
