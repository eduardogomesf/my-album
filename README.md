# Project Overview
**My album** is a backend system that allow users to store and manage their albums, photos and videos in an easy and secure way.

## Description
**My album** follows a microservice event-driven architecture where all the communication between the services works in asynchronous way through a distributed streaming platform (Apache Kafka).

The architecture is composed by three main services: User Management Service, File Manager Service and Notification Service.

## High-level System Design

## Services
The **User Management Service** is responsible for handling the management and authentication of users within the system. This service uses a MongoDB database to save all required information and communicates with other services in an asynchronous way by using Kafka Topics to send messages.

The **File Manager Service** is responsible for allowing users to manage their files. This service uses a Postgres database to save all required information and uses the Amazon S3 service to store the actual files. It also communicates with other services through Kafka topics.

The **Notification Service** is responsible for sending e-mail notifications to users on important occasions. This service is constantly reading messages from Kafka in order to send real-time notifications to the users. It has an integration with MailHog service for Email Testing.

You can find more details in the **[High-Level System Design](#high-level-system-design)** section.
